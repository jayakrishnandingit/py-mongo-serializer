# Mongy (Monkey) Serializer
Serialize MongoDB documents to native Python datatypes that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML or other content types.
I am aiming to make this an opensource project and hence looking for collaborators for improvements and feedback. You can raise a PR or add issues after which  we can work together to resolve it.

# Background
I started this for serializing MongoDB documents as part of one of my projects. However, as it progressed I had an impetus to move this as an independent Open Source work that can be leveraged by others. I do not intend to or claim to replace any of the existing serializers. The code here is completely written by me and there is zero plagiarism.

The sole intention is to have a learning experience along with knowledge sharing plus community help.
